# Spiking-Neural-Networks-for-Event-Based-Vision-Using-Public-Datasets-
This project studies Spiking Neural Networks for event-based vision using neuromorphic datasets. It compares SNNs with traditional ANN/CNN models on N-MNIST and DVS Gesture to evaluate accuracy, temporal behavior, and efficiency for real-time vision tasks.
